# CloudAI-CLI

> **[Work in Progress]** Ask questions about your AWS infrastructure, get answers from a local-first AI.

CloudAI-CLI is a single-binary Go tool that uses a **local-first AI** to answer natural language questions about your cloud infrastructure. It works by scanning your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files to build a knowledge base, ensuring privacy and accuracy.

No more hunting through consoles or memorising `aws cli` flags.

---

## üöÄ Core Concept (Scan then Ask)

The workflow is designed to be private, fast, and developer-friendly:

1.  **Scan:** You run `cloudai scan` in your IaC project directory (e.g., CDK, Terraform). The tool parses your infrastructure definition and saves it to a local `.cloudai/cache.json` file. This step **does not** require AWS credentials.
2.  **Ask:** You ask any question about the scanned infrastructure, like `cloudai "What is the runtime of the main Lambda?"`. The tool uses the local cache and a local LLM (like Ollama) to give you an answer, without sending your data to a third-party service.

_Live AWS account scanning will be added as a fallback option in a future version._

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Scan your project to build a knowledge base
# (This example uses the included demo project)
cd demo-cdk
cloudai scan

# 2. Ask any question about the infrastructure
cloudai "What AWS region is this stack deployed to?"
cloudai "What is the runtime of the cloudai-demo-hello function?"
```

---

## üß™ Demo Setup

To test the tool, you can use the included CDK demo project.

```bash
# Navigate to the demo directory
cd demo-cdk

# Install CDK dependencies
npm install

# Deploy the demo stack to your AWS account
# (Requires AWS credentials to be configured)
npx cdk deploy

# Now you can scan and ask questions as shown in the Quick Start
cloudai scan
cloudai "Which Lambda handles GET /hello on cloudai-demo-api?"

# Clean up when you're done
npx cdk destroy
```

---

## üõ† Installation

```bash
# Requires Go ‚â• 1.22
go install github.com/marko-durasic/CloudAI-CLI@latest

# Or grab a pre-built binary from the Releases page (coming soon)
```

_Add an alias for speed_: `alias cai="cloudai"`
