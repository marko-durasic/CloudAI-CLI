- `ec2-ollama-stack.yaml` (updated)

### 4. 🔒 Privacy-First Architecture Options
**Before**: No privacy considerations
**After**: Two dedicated privacy options (Options 5 & 6)

**New Capabilities**:
- **Hybrid architecture** - local processing + external APIs
- **Data protection** - sensitive infrastructure data never leaves local environment
- **API integration** - OpenAI, Anthropic support  
- **CLI tool support** - Gemini, Bard integration
- **Local validation** - requires Ollama first for privacy layer

### 5. ☁️ AWS Managed Service Integration
**Before**: Limited AWS support
**After**: Full SageMaker and Bedrock integration

**Added Features**:
- **SageMaker setup flow** - guided managed deployment
- **Bedrock integration** - serverless AI with AWS models
- **AWS credential validation** - checks access before setup
- **Cost estimation** - explains AWS pricing models

### 6. 🧠 Production-Grade Infrastructure Analysis
**Before**: Basic file scanning
**After**: Comprehensive IaC analysis engine

**Advanced Capabilities**:
- **CDK project support** - reads compiled CloudFormation templates
- **Multi-format readiness** - prepared for Terraform, CloudFormation, SAM
- **Intelligent caching** - efficient infrastructure topology storage
- **Natural language Q&A** - answers complex architecture questions
- **Cost analysis** - identifies expensive services automatically
- **Security insights** - spots potential configuration risks

**Files Enhanced**: `internal/state/provider.go` (improved error handling)

### 7. 📚 Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul
**Before**: Basic README
**After**: Complete documentation suite

**Documentation Added**:
- **Comprehensive README** - 342 lines of detailed usage instructions
- **EC2 Deployment Guide** - 219 lines covering quota management, costs, troubleshooting
- **Setup Progress Tracking** - detailed feature completion status
- **Testing Guide** - step-by-step validation instructions for all features
- **Development Summary** - this document capturing all work completed
